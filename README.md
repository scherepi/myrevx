Virtual Reverend X is a silly little toy I made in an hour or two because I found a strange obscure figure from the late 90s very funny and I'm trying not to go insane. Reverend X (real name Vincent Stewart) was a preacher on an LA public access television show called The One-Man Show around the turn of the century. He said wild stuff all the time and had a killer crip walk. 
I think he's awesome. Praise our lord Reverend X.
